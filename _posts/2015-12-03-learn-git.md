# Learn Git

Git is a software that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time. Git works by recording the changes you make to a project, storing those changes, then allowing you to reference them as needed.

**Initialization**

      git init

The word `init` means initialize. The command sets up all the tools Git needs to begin tracking changes made to the project.

**Git Workflow**

![Git Workflow](https://github.com/jeffjiezhou/jeffjiezhou.github.io/blob/master/img/GitWorkflow.png?raw=true)

* A *Working Directory*: where you'll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files.
* A *Staging Area*: where you'll list changes you make to the working directory.
* A *Repository*: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project

The Git workflow consists of editing files in the working directory, adding files to the staging area, and saving changes to a Git repository.
